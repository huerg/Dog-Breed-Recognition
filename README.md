# Dog-Breed-Recognition

## Intro

This project deals with different deep learning based methods for dog breed recognition. In addition to that, some face detection applications using Haar-Series will be introduced.

The breed recognition applications are based on CNNs, both trained from scratch and pretrained. The latter was programmed by using the convolutional base of a ResNet50 model.

For a real wolrd application of these models see the [dog pricing tool of Adam Riese GmbH](https://www.adam-riese.de/hundehalter/) in which a credibility based actuarial model for dog liability was combined with an image classification model for the risk adjusted pricing of mixed breed dogs.
